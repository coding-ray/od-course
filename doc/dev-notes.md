# Contribution and Developing Rules and Notes

## Rules

1.  To contribute to this repository, please install [latexindent.pl](https://github.com/cmhughes/latexindent.pl) for formatting TeX files.

1.  (Optional) Install the VS Code extension [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop).

1.  With VS Code, if you're using Arch Linux, please install the following packages for `latexindent` to work.

        sudo pacman -S texlive-binextra perl-yaml-tiny

    <details>
    <summary>Reasons (click to expand/hide):</summary>

    `texlive-binextra` provides `latexindent` and allows VS Code to access `latexmk` command that LaTeX Workshop requires. (References: [ref.1](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76565246), [ref.2](https://archlinux.org/news/tex-live-package-reorganization/))

    `perl-yaml-tiny` provides the `YAML::Tiny` module that `latexindent` required. ([Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59784628))

## Notes for Maintainers

### Make a New Release

1.  To release handouts and syllabus on GitHub, for now, please [build them in Docker](#docker-handout) for a consistent environment, and add the files to a release manually.

### Publish the Environment Image to Docker Hub

1.  Generate an access token from the [settings page](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) with permissions to read, write, delete images.

1.  In a Linux machine, log in Docker Hub with the token.

    ```bash
    docker login -u rays2
    ```

1.  Build the handout-environment image.

    ```bash
    cd src/build-handouts/env-image
    ./build-image.sh
    ```

1.  (Optional) Check the compiling result.

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ./build-handouts.sh
    cd env-image
    ```

1.  Push the images to Docker Hub.

    ```bash
    ./publish-image.sh
    ```
